Kurt Friedrich Gödel (b. 1906, d. 1978) was one of the principal founders of the modern, metamathematical era in mathematical logic. He is widely known for his Incompleteness Theorems, which are among the handful of landmark theorems in twentieth century mathematics, but his work touched every field of mathematical logic, if it was not in most cases their original stimulus. In his philosophical work Gödel formulated and defended mathematical Platonism, the view that mathematics is a descriptive science, or alternatively the view that the concept of mathematical truth is objective. On the basis of that viewpoint he laid the foundation for the program of conceptual analysis within set theory (see below). He adhered to Hilbert’s “original rationalistic conception” in mathematics (as he called it);[1] and he was prophetic in anticipating and emphasizing the importance of large cardinals in set theory before their importance became clear.

1. Biographical Sketch
Kurt Gödel was born on April 28, 1906 in what was then the Austro-Hungarian city of Brünn, and what is now Brno in the Czech Republic.

Gödel’s father Rudolf August was a businessman, and his mother Marianne was a well-educated and cultured woman to whom Gödel remained close throughout his life, as witnessed by the long and wide-ranging correspondence between them. The family was well off, and Gödel’s childhood was an uneventful one, with one important exception; namely, from about the age of four Gödel suffered frequent episodes of poor health, and the health problems he suffered then as well as others of various kinds were to plague him his entire life.

Health problems notwithstanding, Gödel proved to be an exemplary student at primary school and later the Gymnasium, excelling especially in mathematics, languages and religion. Upon his graduation from the Gymnasium in Brno in 1924 Gödel enrolled in the University of Vienna, attending lectures on physics, his initial field of interest, lectures on philosophy given by Heinrich Gomperz, and lectures on mathematics. Gödel took a number of physics courses during his undergraduate years, as witnessed by his university transcript; this is notable in view of Gödel’s subsequent contributions to relativity in 1947. Philipp Furtwängler, cousin of the great German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, was one of his mathematics professors, and indeed Furtwängler’s course on class field theory almost tempted Gödel to pursue his studies in that area. Gödel learned his logic from Rudolph Carnap and from Hans Hahn, eventually graduating under Hahn with a Dr.phil. in mathematics in 1929. The main theorem of his dissertation was the completeness theorem for first order logic (Gödel 1929).[2]

Gödel’s university years also marked the beginning of his attendance at meetings of the Vienna Circle, a group around Moritz Schlick that quickly became known as “logical positivists,” a term coined by Feigl and Blumberg in their 1931 “Logical positivism: A new movement in European philosophy” (Feigl and Blumberg 1931). Though Gödel was not himself a logical positivist, those discussions were a crucial formative influence.

The 1930s were a prodigious decade for Gödel. After publishing his 1929 dissertation in 1930, he published his groundbreaking incompleteness theorems in 1931, on the basis of which he was granted his Habilitation in 1932 and a Privatdozentur at the University of Vienna in 1933.

Among his mathematical achievements at the decade’s close is the proof of the consistency of both the Axiom of Choice and Cantor’s Continuum Hypothesis with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory, obtained in 1935 and 1937, respectively. Gödel also published a number of significant papers on modal and intuitionistic logic and arithmetic during this period, principal among which is his “On intuitionistic arithmetic and number theory,” (Gödel 1933e), in which he showed that classical first order arithmetic is interpretable in Heyting arithmetic by a simple translation. Other publications of the 1930s include those on the decision problem for the predicate calculus, on the length of proofs, and on differential and projective geometry.

By the end of the decade both Gödel’s advisor Hans Hahn and Moritz Schlick had died (the latter was assassinated by an ex-student), two events which led to a personal crisis for Gödel. Also, his appointment at the University, that of Privatdozentur, was cancelled, being replaced by the position “Dozentur neuer Ordnung,” granted to candidates only after they had passed a racial test.[3] Gödel’s three trips the United States during that decade triggered an investigation. (See Sigmund 2006.) Finally, Gödel was found fit for military service by the Nazi government in 1939.

All of these events were decisive in influencing his decision to leave Austria in 1940, when he and his wife Adele emigrated to the United States. This long and difficult episode in their life is recounted by John Dawson in his biography of Gödel called “Logical Dilemmas,” (Dawson 1997) as well as by Solomon Feferman in “Gödel’s Life and Work,” (Feferman 1986) to both of which the reader is referred.

Upon arrival Gödel took up an appointment as an ordinary member at the Institute for Advanced Study; he would become a permanent member of the Institute in 1946 and would be granted his professorship in 1953. (Gödel and his wife were granted American citizenship in April 1948.) He would remain at the Institute until his retirement in 1976. The Gödels never returned to Europe.

Gödel’s early years at the Institute were notable for his close friendship with his daily walking partner Albert Einstein, as well as for his turn to philosophy of mathematics, a field on which Gödel began to concentrate almost exclusively from about 1943. The initial period of his subsequent lifelong involvement with philosophy was a fruitful one (in terms of publications): in 1944 he published his first philosophical paper, entitled “On Russell’s Mathematical Logic” (Gödel 1944), and in 1947 he published his second, entitled “What is Cantor’s Continuum Hypothesis?” (Gödel 1947). In 1949 he published his third, entitled “A Remark on the Relationship between Relativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy.” (Gödel 1949a). The latter paper coincided with results on rotating universes in relativity he had obtained in 1949, which were first published in an article entitled: “An Example of a New Type of Cosmological Solutions of Einstein’s Field Equations of Gravitation.” (Gödel 1949).

Among Gödel’s other significant philosophical works of the 1940s must be counted his 1941 lecture entitled “In What Sense is Intuitionistic Logic Constructive?” (Gödel *1941) in which the notion: “computable function of finite type” is introduced. A paper based on the ideas in the lecture entitled “Über eine bisher noch nicht benützte Erweiterung des finiten Standpunktes,” was published only in 1958, and the interpretation of Heyting arithmetic into the quantifier free calculus T in it became known as the “Dialectica Interpretation,” after the journal in which the article was published (Gödel 1958). (For the revision of it from 1972, see Gödel 1995.) Finally the decade saw the beginning of Gödel’s intensive study of Leibniz, which, Gödel reports, occupied the period from 1943 to 1946.[4]

The 1950s saw a deepening of Gödel’s involvement with philosophy: In 1951 Gödel delivered a philosophical lecture at Brown University, usually referred to as the Gibbs Lecture, entitled “Some Basic Theorems on the Foundations of Mathematics and Their Philosophical Implications” (Gödel *1951). From 1953 to 1959 Gödel worked on a submission to the Schilpp volume on Rudolf Carnap entitled “Is Mathematics a Syntax of Language?” (Gödel *1953/9-III, Gödel *1953/9-V). Gödel published neither of these two important manuscripts in his lifetime, although both would appear on two lists which were found in the Gödel Nachlass, entitled “Was ich publizieren könnte.” (In English: “What I could publish.” Both manuscripts eventually appeared in Gödel 1995.) By the decade’s close Gödel developed a serious interest in phenomenology.[5]

Gödel’s final years are notable for his circulation of two manuscripts: “Some considerations leading to the probable conclusion that the true power of the continuum is ℵ2,” (Gödel *1970a, *1970b) his attempt to derive the value of the continuum from the so-called scale axioms of Hausdorff, and his “Ontologischer Beweis,” (Gödel *1970) which he entrusted to Dana Scott in 1970 (though it appears to have been written earlier). Taken together, the two manuscripts are the fitting last words of someone who, in a fifty year involvement with mathematics and philosophy, pursued, or more precisely, sought the grounds for pursuing those two subjects under the single heading: “strenge Wissenschaft”—a turn of mind that had been in place from Gödel’s start in 1929, when at the age of twenty-three he opened his doctoral thesis with some philosophical remarks.

Gödel died in Princeton on January 14, 1978 at the age of 71. His death certificate records the cause of death as “starvation and inanition, due to personality disorder.” His wife Adele survived him by three years.

2. Gödel’s Mathematical Work
Below is an examination of some of Gödel’s main contributions in logic and set theory. This treatment of Gödel’s technical work is not exhaustive, omitting discussion of Gödel’s work in physics and his work on the decision problem. These will be treated in the sequel to this entry.

For a complete chronology of Gödel’s work the reader is referred to that compiled by John Dawson in volume I of Gödel’s Collected Works (Gödel 1986, p. 37).

2.1 The Completeness Theorem
2.1.1 Introduction
The completeness question for the first order predicate calculus was stated precisely and in print for the first time in 1928 by Hilbert and Ackermann in their text Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik (Hilbert and Ackermann 1928), a text with which Gödel would have been quite familiar.[6]

The question Hilbert and Ackermann pose is whether a certain explicitly given axiom system for the first order predicate calculus “…is complete in the sense that from it all logical formulas that are correct for each domain of individuals can be derived…” (van Heijenoort 1967, p. 48).

2.1.2 Proof of the Completeness Theorem
We give an outline of Gödel’s own proof in his doctoral thesis (Gödel 1929). An essential difference with earlier efforts (discussed below and elsewhere, e.g. in Zach 1999), is that Gödel defines meticulously all the relevant basic concepts.

A “logical expression” in Gödel’s terminology is a well-formed first order formula without identity. An expression is “refutable” if its negation is provable, “valid” if it is true in every interpretation and “satisfiable” if it is true in some interpretation. The Completeness Theorem is stated as follows:

Theorem 1.
Every valid logical expression is provable. Equivalently, every logical expression is either satisfiable or refutable.
Gödel’s proof calculus is that of Hilbert and Ackermann’s text. An expression is in normal form if all the quantifiers occur at the beginning. The degree of an expression or formula is the number of alternating blocks of quantifiers at the beginning of the formula, assumed to begin with universal quantifiers. Gödel shows that if the completeness theorem holds for formulas of degree k it must hold for formulas of degree k + 1. Thus the question of completeness reduces to formulas of degree 1. That is, it is to be shown that any normal formula (Q)φ of degree 1 is either satisfiable or refutable, where “(Q)” stands for a (non-empty) block of universal quantifiers followed by a (possibly empty) block of existential ones.

Gödel defines a book-keeping device, a well-ordering of all tuples of variables arising from a need to satisfy φ as dictated by (Q). For example, if (Q)φ is ∀x0∃x1ψ(x0, x1), we list the quantifier-free formulas ψ(xn, xn+1). (Or more precisely, finite conjunctions of these in increasing length. See below.) Then in any domain consisting of the values of the different xn, in which each ψ(xn, xn+1) is true, the sentence (Q)φ is clearly true. A crucial lemma claims the provability, for each k, of the formula (Q)φ → (Qk)φk, where the quantifier free formula φk asserts the truth of ψ for all tuples up to the kth tuple of variables arising from (Q), and (Qk)φk is the existential closure of φk. (See the example below where the definition of the φk′s is given.) This lemma is the main step missing from the various earlier attempts at the proof due to Löwenheim and Skolem, and, in the context of the completeness theorem for first order logic, renders the connection between syntax and semantics completely explicit.

Let us consider an example of how a particular formula would be found to be either satisfiable or its negation provable, following Gödel’s method: Consider φ = ∀x0∃x1ψ(x0, x1), where ψ(x0, x1) is quantifier-free. We show that this is either refutable or satisfiable. We make the following definitions:

φ0 is the expression ψ(x0, x1)
φ1 is the expression ψ(x0, x1) ∧ ψ(x1, x2)
…
φn is the expression ψ(x0, x1) ∧ …∧ ψ(xn, xn+1).
The crucial lemma, referred to above, shows that from φ we can derive for each n, ∃x0…∃xn+1φn.

Case 1: For some n, φn is not satisfiable. Then, Gödel argued, using the already known completeness theorem for propositional logic,[7] that ¬φn is provable, and hence so is ∀x0,…, xn+1¬φn. Thus ¬∃x0…∃xn+1φn is provable and therefore the ¬φ is provable, i.e., φ is refutable in the Hilbert-Ackermann system. (Some partial results about propositional logic in addition to those already mentioned include the semantic completeness of the propositional calculus due to Post (1921), as well as a more general completeness theorem for the same due to Bernays in 1918; the latter appears in Bernays’ unpublished Habilitationsschrift of 1918; see also Bernays 1926.)

Case 2: Each φn is satisfiable. There are only finitely many possible models with universe x0,…, xn+1. Gödel orders them as a tree by defining a model M to be below a model M′ if M is a submodel of M′. In this way we obtain a tree which is finitely branching but infinite. By König’s Lemma there is an infinite branch B. (In the proof, Gödel explicitly constructs the branch given by König’s Lemma rather than citing it by name.) The union of the models on B forms a model M with universe x0, x1,…. Since M satisfies each φn, the original formula φ holds in M. So φ is satisfiable and we are done.

Note that the model, in the satisfiability case of Gödel’s proof, is always countable. Thus this proof of the Completeness Theorem gives also the Löweheim-Skolem Theorem (see below). Gödel extends the result to countably many formulas and to the case of first order logic with identity. He also proves the independence of the axioms.

In 1930 Gödel published the paper based on his thesis (Gödel 1930) notable also for the inclusion of the compactness theorem, which is only implicitly stated in the thesis. The theorem as stated by Gödel in Gödel 1930 is as follows: a countably infinite set of quantificational formulas is satisfiable if and only if every finite subset of those formulas is satisfiable. Gödel uses compactness to derive a generalization of the completeness theorem.

The Compactness Theorem was extended to the case of uncountable vocabularies by Maltsev in 1936 see Mal’cev 1971, from which the Upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem immediately follows. The Compactness Theorem would become one of the main tools in the then fledgling subject of model theory.

2.1.3 An Important Consequence of the Completeness Theorem
A theory is said to be categorical if it has only one model up to isomorphism; it is λ-categorical if it has only one model of cardinality λ, up to isomorphism. One of the main consequences of the completeness theorem is that categoricity fails for Peano arithmetic and for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

In detail, regarding the first order Peano axioms (henceforth PA), the existence of non-standard models of them actually follows from completeness together with compactness. One constructs these models, which contain infinitely large integers, as follows: add a new constant symbol c to the language of arithmetic. Extend PA to a new theory PA* by adding to it the infinite collection of axioms: c  0, c  1, …, where, e.g., 3 is S(S(S(0))). PA* is finitely consistent (i.e., every finite subset of PA* is consistent) hence consistent, hence by the Completeness Theorem it has a model.

This simple fact about models of Peano arithmetic was not pointed out by Gödel in any of the publications connected with the Completeness Theorem from that time, and it seems not to have been noticed by the general logic community until much later. Skolem’s definable ultrapower construction from 1933 (see Skolem 1933) gives a direct construction of a non-standard model of True Arithmetic (which extends Peano arithmetic, being the set of arithmetic sentences true in the natural numbers). But Skolem never mentions the fact that the existence of such models follows from the completeness and compactness theorems. Gödel in his review (1934c) of Skolem’s paper also does not mention this fact, rather observing that the failure of categoricity for arithmetic follows from the incompleteness theorem.

As for set theory, the failure of categoricity was already taken note of by Skolem in 1923, because it follows from the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem (which Skolem arrived at that year; see Skolem 1923, based on Löwenheim 1915 and Skolem 1920): any first order theory in a countable language that has a model has a countable model.

Skolem’s observation that categoricity fails for set theory because it has countable models is now known as the Skolem paradox.[8]The observation is strongly emphasized in Skolem’s paper, which is accordingly entitled ‘An Observation on the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory’ As he wrote in the conclusion of it, he had not pointed out the relativity in set theory already in 1915 because:

… first, I have in the meantime been occupied with other problems; second, I believed that it was so clear that axiomatization in terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of mathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very much concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise that so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory provide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it seemed to me that the time had come to publish a critique. (English translation taken from van Heijenoort 1967, p. 300.)

As an aside, in the proof of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, specifically that part of the theorem in which one constructs a model for a satisfiable sentence, Löwenheim and Skolem’s tree construction was more or less the same as appears in Gödel’s thesis. In a 1967 letter to Hao Wang, Gödel takes note of the fact that his completeness proof had almost been obtained by Skolem in 1923. Though van Heijenoort and Dreben (Dreben and van Heijenoort 1986) remark that “Throughout much of the 1920s it was not semantic completeness but the decision problem for quantificational validity, a problem originating from the work of Schröder and Löwenheim, that was the dominant concern in studying quantification theory” (examples of such results would include the decision procedure for the first order monadic predicate calculus due to Behmann, (Behmann 1922)), according to Gödel, the reasons that Skolem did not obtain the complete proof are different and philosophically important, having to do with the then dominant bias against semantics and against infinitary methods:

The Completeness Theorem, mathematically, is indeed an almost trivial consequence of Skolem 1923. However, the fact is that, at that time, nobody (including Skolem himself) drew this conclusion neither from Skolem 1923 nor, as I did, from similar considerations of his own …This blindness (or prejudice, or whatever you may call it) of logicians is indeed surprising. But I think the explanation is not hard to find. It lies in the widespread lack, at that time, of the required epistemological attitude toward metamathematics and toward non-finitary reasoning. (Gödel 2003b).
The matter of Skolem’s contribution to the Completeness Theorem has been extensively discussed in van Atten and Kennedy 2009, as well as in van Atten 2005.

2.2 The Incompleteness Theorems
Gödel mentioned the possibility of the unsolvability of a question about the reals already in his 1929 thesis, in arguing against the formalist principle of Hilbert’s, that consistency is a criterion for existence. In fact, giving a finitary proof of the consistency of analysis was a key desideratum of what was then known as the Hilbert program, along with proving its completeness. Accordingly it was Gödel’s turn to these questions, especially the first, which led him to the two incompleteness theorems. (For a discussion of the Hilbert Program the reader is referred to the standard references: Sieg 1990, 1988, 1999; Mancosu 1998, Zach 2003, Tait 1981 and Tait 2002.)

The First Incompleteness Theorem provides a counterexample to completeness by exhibiting an arithmetic statement which is neither provable nor refutable in Peano arithmetic, though true in the standard model. The Second Incompleteness Theorem shows that the consistency of arithmetic cannot be proved in arithmetic itself. Thus Gödel’s theorems demonstrated the infeasibility of the Hilbert program, if it is to be characterized by those particular desiderata, consistency and completeness.

As an aside, von Neumann understood the two theorems this way, even before Gödel did. In fact von Neumann went much further in taking the view that they showed the infeasibility of classical mathematics altogether. As he wrote to Carnap in June of 1931:

Thus today I am of the opinion that 1. Gödel has shown the unrealizability of Hilbert’s program. 2. There is no more reason to reject intuitionism (if one disregards the aesthetic issue, which in practice will also for me be the decisive factor). Therefore I consider the state of the foundational discussion in Königsberg to be outdated, for Gödel’s fundamental discoveries have brought the question to a completely different level.[9]
And the previous fall von Neumann had written to Gödel in even stronger terms:

Thus, I think that your result has solved negatively the foundational question: there is no rigorous justification for classical mathematics. (Gödel 2003b, p. 339)
It would take Gödel himself a few years to see that those aspects of the Hilbert Program had been decisively refuted by his results (Mancosu 2004).

2.2.1 The First Incompleteness Theorem
In his Logical Journey (Wang 1996) Hao Wang published the full text of material Gödel had written (at Wang’s request) about his discovery of the incompleteness theorems. This material had formed the basis of Wang’s “Some Facts about Kurt Gödel,” and was read and approved by Gödel:

In the summer of 1930 I began to study the consistency problem of classical analysis. It is mysterious why Hilbert wanted to prove directly the consistency of analysis by finitary methods. I saw two distinguishable problems: to prove the consistency of number theory by finitary number theory and to prove the consistency of analysis by number theory … Since the domain of finitary number theory was not well-defined, I began by tackling the second half… I represented real numbers by predicates in number theory… and found that I had to use the concept of truth (for number theory) to verify the axioms of analysis. By an enumeration of symbols, sentences and proofs within the given system, I quickly discovered that the concept of arithmetic truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. If it were possible to define truth in the system itself, we would have something like the liar paradox, showing the system to be inconsistent… Note that this argument can be formalized to show the existence of undecidable propositions without giving any individual instances. (If there were no undecidable propositions, all (and only) true propositions would be provable within the system. But then we would have a contradiction.)… In contrast to truth, provability in a given formal system is an explicit combinatorial property of certain sentences of the system, which is formally specifiable by suitable elementary means…
We see that Gödel first tried to reduce the consistency problem for analysis to that of arithmetic. This seemed to require a truth definition for arithmetic, which in turn led to paradoxes, such as the Liar paradox (“This sentence is false”) and Berry’s paradox (“The least number not defined by an expression consisting of just fourteen English words”). Gödel then noticed that such paradoxes would not necessarily arise if truth were replaced by provability. But this means that arithmetic truth and arithmetic provability are not co-extensive — whence the First Incompleteness Theorem.

This account of Gödel’s discovery was told to Hao Wang very much after the fact; but in Gödel’s contemporary correspondence with Bernays and Zermelo, essentially the same description of his path to the theorems is given. (See Gödel 2003a and Gödel 2003b respectively.) From those accounts we see that the undefinability of truth in arithmetic, a result credited to Tarski, was likely obtained in some form by Gödel by 1931. But he neither publicized nor published the result; the biases logicians had expressed at the time concerning the notion of truth, biases which came vehemently to the fore when Tarski announced his results on the undefinability of truth in formal systems 1935, may have served as a deterrent to Gödel’s publication of that theorem.

2.2.2 The proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem
We now describe the proof of the two theorems, formulating Gödel’s results in Peano arithmetic. Gödel himself used a system related to that defined in Principia Mathematica, but containing Peano arithmetic. In our presentation of the First and Second Incompleteness Theorems we refer to Peano arithmetic as P, following Gödel’s notation.

Before proceeding to the details of the formal proof, we define the notion of ω-consistency used by Gödel in the First Incompleteness Theorem: P is ω-consistent if P ⊢ ¬φ(n) for all n implies P ⊬ ∃xφ(x). Naturally this implies consistency and follows from the assumption that the natural numbers satisfy the axioms of Peano arithmetic.

One of the main technical tools used in the proof is Gödel numbering, a mechanism which assigns natural numbers to terms and formulas of our formal theory P. There are different ways of doing this. The most common is based on the unique representation of natural numbers as products of powers of primes. Each symbol s of number theory is assigned a positive natural number #(s) in a fixed but arbitrary way, e.g.

#(0) = 1	#(=) = 5	#(¬) = 9
#(1) = 2	#( ( ) = 6	#(∀) = 10
#(+) = 3	#( ) ) = 7	#(vi) = 11 + i
#(×) = 4	#(∧) = 8	 
The natural number corresponding to a sequence w =  w0,…, wk  of symbols is

⌈w⌉ = 2#(w0) · 3#(w1) · … · pk#(wk),
where pk is the k+1st prime. It is called its Gödel number and denoted by ⌈w⌉. In this way we can assign Gödel numbers to formulas, sequences of formulas (once a method for distinguishing when one formula ends and another begins has been adopted), and most notably, proofs.

An essential point here is that when a formula is construed as a natural number, then the numeral corresponding to that natural number can occur as the argument of a formula, thus enabling the syntax to “refer” to itself, so to speak (i.e., when a numeral is substituted into a formula the Gödel number of which the numeral represents). This will eventually allow Gödel to formalize the Liar paradox (with “provability” in place of “truth”) by substituting into the formula which says, ‘the formula, whose code is x, is unprovable,’ its own natural number code (or more precisely the corresponding numeral).

Another concept required to carry out the formalization is the concept of numeralwise expressibility of number theoretic predicates. A number-theoretic formula φ(n1, …, nk) is numeralwise expressible in P if for each tuple of natural numbers (n1, …, nk):

N ⊨ φ(n1, …, nk)	⇒	P ⊢ φ(n1, …, nk)
N ⊨ ¬φ(n1, …, nk)	⇒	P ⊢ ¬φ(n1, …, nk)
where n is the formal term which denotes the natural number n. (In P, this is S(S(…S(0)…), where n is the number of iterations of the successor function applied to the constant symbol 0.) One of the principal goals is to numeralwise express the predicate

Prf(x, y): ‘the sequence with Gödel number x is a proof of the sentence with Gödel number y.’
Reaching this goal involves defining forty-five relations, each defined in terms of the preceding ones. These relations are all primitive recursive.[10] Relations needed are, among others, those which assert of a natural number that it codes a sequence, or a formula, or an axiom, or that it is the code, denoted by Sb(ru1…unZ(x1)…Z(xn)), of a formula obtained from a formula with code r by substituting for its free variable ui the xi th numeral for i = 1, …, n. The forty-fifth primitive recursive relation defined is Prf(x, y), and the forty-sixth is

Prov(y): ‘the sentence with Gödel number y is provable in P’
which without being primitive recursive, is however obtained from Prf(x, y) by existentially quantifying x. (Prov(y) satisfies only the ‘positive’ part of numeralwise expressibility, and not the negative part; but the negative part is not needed.)

In Theorem V of his paper, Gödel proves that any number theoretic predicate which is primitive recursive is numeralwise expressible in P. Thus since Prf(x, y) and substitution are primitive recursive, these are decided by P when closed terms are substituted for the free variables x and y. This is the heart of the matter as we will see. Another key point about numeralwise expressibility is that although we informally interpret, for example, Prov(Sb(ru1…unZ(x1)…Z(xn))), by: ‘the formula with Gödel number r is provable if the Gödel number for the xi th numeral is substituted in place of the i th variable,’ neither the formal statement within the theory P nor anything we prove about it appeals to such meanings. On the contrary Prov(Sb(ru1…unZ(x1)…Z(xn))), is a meaningless string of logical and arithmetical symbols. As Gödel puts it in his introduction to his theorem V, ‘The fact that can be formulated vaguely by saying that every recursive relation is definable in the system P (if the usual meaning is given to the formulas of this system) is expressed in precise language, without reference to any interpretation of the formulas of P, by the following Theorem (V) (Gödel 1986, p. 171, italics Gödel’s).

Gödel in his incompleteness theorems uses a method given in what is called nowadays Gödel’s Fixed Point Theorem. Although Gödel constructs a fixed point in the course of proving the incompleteness theorem, he does not state the fixed point theorem explicitly. The fixed point theorem is as follows:

Theorem 2 (Gödel’s Fixed Point Theorem)
If φ(v0) is a formula of number theory, then there is a sentence ψ such that P ⊢ ψ ↔ φ(⌈ψ⌉), where ⌈ψ⌉ is the formal term corresponding to the natural number code of ⌈ψ⌉.

Proof: Let σ(x,y,z) be a formula that numeralwise expresses the number theoretic predicate ‘y is the Gödel number of the formula obtained by replacing the variable v0 in the formula whose Gödel number is x by the term z’. Let θ(v0) be the formula ∃v1(φ(v1) ∧ σ(v0, v1, v0)). Let k = ⌈θ(v0)⌉ and ψ = θ(k). Now directly by the construction P ⊢ ψ ↔ φ(⌈ψ⌉).

A sentence is refutable from a theory if its negation is provable. The First Incompleteness Theorem as Gödel stated it is as follows:

Theorem 3 (Gödel’s First Incompleteness Theorem)
If P is ω-consistent, then there is a sentence which is neither provable nor refutable from P.

Proof: By judicious coding of syntax referred to above, write a formula Prf(x,y)[11] of number theory, representable in P, so that

n codes a proof of φ ⇒ P ⊢ Prf(n, ⌈φ⌉).
and

n does not code a proof of φ ⇒ P ⊢ ¬Prf(n, ⌈φ⌉).
Let Prov(y) denote the formula ∃x Prf(x,y)[12]. By Theorem 2 there is a sentence φ with the property

P ⊢ (φ ↔ ¬Prov(⌈φ⌉)).
Thus φ says ‘I am not provable.’ We now observe, if P ⊢ φ, then by (1) there is n such that P ⊢ Prf(n, ⌈φ⌉), hence P ⊢ Prov(⌈φ⌉), hence, by (3) P ⊢ ¬φ, so P is inconsistent. Thus

P ⊬ φ
Furthermore, by (4) and (2), we have P ⊢ ¬Prf(n, ⌈φ⌉) for all natural numbers n. By ω-consistency P ⊬ ∃x Prf(x, ⌈φ⌉). Thus (3) gives P ⊬ ¬φ. We have shown that if P is ω-consistent, then φ is independent of P.

On concluding the proof of the first theorem, Gödel remarks, “we can readily see that the proof just given is constructive; that is … proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable manner…” (Gödel 1986, p. 177). This is because, as he points out, all the existential statements are based on his theorem V (giving the numeralwise expressibility of primitive recursive relations), which is intuitionistically unobjectionable.

2.2.3 The Second Incompleteness Theorem
The Second Incompleteness Theorem establishes the unprovability, in number theory, of the consistency of number theory. First we have to write down a number-theoretic formula that expresses the consistency of the axioms. This is surprisingly simple. We just let Con(P) be the sentence ¬Prov(⌈0 = 1⌉).

Theorem 4 (Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem) If P is consistent, then Con(P) is not provable from P.

Proof: Let φ be as in (3). The reasoning used to infer ‘if P ⊢ φ, then P ⊢ 0 ≠ 1‘ does not go beyond elementary number theory, and can therefore, albeit with a lot of effort (see below), be formalized in P. This yields: P ⊢ (Prov(⌈φ⌉) → ¬Con(P)), and thus by (3), P ⊢ (Con(P) → φ). Since P ⊬ φ, we must have P ⊬ Con(P).

The above proof (sketch) of the Second Incompleteness Theorem is deceptively simple as it avoids the formalization. A rigorous proof would have to establish the proof of ‘if P ⊢ φ, then P ⊢ 0 ≠ 1’ in P.

It is noteworthy that ω-consistency is not needed in the proof of Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem. Also note that neither is ¬Con(P) provable, by the consistency of P and the fact, now known as Löb’s theorem, that P ⊢ Prov(⌈φ⌉) implies P ⊢ φ.

The assumption of ω-consistency in the First Incompleteness Theorem was eliminated by Rosser in 1936, and replaced by the weaker notion of consistency. Rosser’s generalization involves applying the fixed point theorem to the formula R(x): ‘for all z: either z is not the Gödel number of a proof of the formula with Gödel number x or there is a proof shorter than z of the negation of (the formula with Gödel number) x’ (see Rosser 1936).

With regard to the Second Incompleteness Theorem, the argument relies in part on formalizing the proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem as we saw. This step is omitted in Gödel 1931. He planned to include the step in what would have been a second part II (see footnote 48a of Gödel 1931). But instead of writing it he turned to the continuum problem.[13] (Part II was to elaborate on other points too: the ‘true reason for incompleteness,’ and the applicability of the two theorems to other systems.) He perhaps did not feel compelled to attend to what looked like an exercise in formalization, relying instead on the informal argument to convince (in which it succeeded). However this step turned out to be somewhat non-trivial. As Kleene puts it in his introduction to Gödel 1931, of the informal presentation, “Certainly the idea of the argument for Theorem XI (consistency) was very convincing; but it turned out that the execution of the details required somewhat more work and care than had been anticipated.” (See pp. 126–141 of Gödel 1986.) Eventually a complete proof of the Second Theorem was given by Hilbert and Bernays in some seventy pages in their Hilbert and Bernays 1939. A much more compact treatment of the theorem was given by Löb in his Löb 1956, and subsequently Feferman, in his 1960 “Arithmetization of Metamathematics in a General Setting” (Feferman 1960/1961), gave a succinct and completely general treatment of both the First and Second Theorems.
